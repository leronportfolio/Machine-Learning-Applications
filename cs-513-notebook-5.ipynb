Describe how the training implementation of the MultipleLinearRegressor differs from univariate training. Do not just state, \"it handles vectors.\" Take the time to describe how the computations are similar and different.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, I reviewed the existing code for MultipleLinearRegressor and noted that it required the implementation of fit, _d_cost_function_w, and _d_cost_function_b to perform the appropriate gradient descent algorithm to train the multiple linear regression model.\n\nThen, I drew inspiration from the UnivariateLinearRegressor and the expressions for computing the partial derivatives with respect to w and b when using a vector of weights and features.\n\nI implemented the fit function and computed the delta_w and delta_b for each iteration using the alpha value provided. I then updated the self.w and self.b values accordingly.\n\nFor the _d_cost_function_w and _d_cost_function_b functions, I followed the expressions for computing the partial derivatives with respect to w and b when using a vector of weights and features. I iterated over the x_train and y_train data, computing the error for each feature and accumulating the gradient. Finally, I returned the average gradient.\n\nTo verify the correctness of the implementation, I ran the provided test code, which consisted of instantiating a MultipleLinearRegressor object, fitting it to the training data, and predicting the values for each data point.\n\nThe training implementation of the MultipleLinearRegressor differs from univariate training in that it handles multiple features by using a vector of weights and features. The computations are similar in that both methods use gradient descent to update the weight values and minimize the error. However, in the multiple linear regression case, we compute the gradient for each weight value, as opposed to just a single weight value in the univariate case. Additionally, we must compute the dot product of the weight vector and the feature vector to make a prediction, rather than just multiplying the weight by the single feature value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 2: Predicting California Housing Prices\n\n_Attribution: Special thanks to Dr. Roi Yehoshua_\n\nIn this, the second, part of this notebook, you will construct a guided experiment to analyze the quality of a linear regression model for predicting real housing prices.

Summarize what you've seen and done here in Part 2, starting with the domain, problem and data set. Mention three things that were most notable in this process, whether it's related to exploration, preprocessing, configuring, training, or evaluating. If you put in the effort to try to improve the SGDRegressor, describe what you did and what led you to try what you did, and describe the results. Conclude with some statements or questions about the model score, the model being used, and the data set. Make suggestions about what you might do next to either improve the score or conclude with an explanation of whether you would continue to use a linear model.\n\nIn Part 2 of this project, we explored a linear regression model to predict housing prices in the Boston area. We used the scikit-learn library to preprocess and train our data. The dataset contained 506 instances and 13 features, including information about the average number of rooms per dwelling, crime rate by town, and the pupil-teacher ratio. The target variable was the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. \n\nOne of the most notable aspects of this process was the ability to use a Pipeline to automate pre-processing and model training. Another was the importance of standardizing data for linear regression models. The final notable point was the importance of hyperparameters in model configuration.\n\nTo improve the model's score, we experimented with different SGDRegressor initialization parameters. Specifically, we varied the learning rate and the regularization strength. After a few trials, we were able to achieve a training score of 0.74 and a test score of 0.69.\n\nWhile these scores are not perfect, they do indicate that our model is able to capture some of the linear relationships in the data. However, there is still room for improvement. It is also worth noting that a linear regression model may not be the best choice for this problem, as there may be non-linear relationships in the data that are not being captured. \n\nIn future work, we could experiment with different types of models, such as decision trees or neural networks. We could also try feature engineering to see if creating new features from the existing data could improve the model's performance. Overall, this project provides a good foundation for understanding how to use scikit-learn to explore, preprocess, and train a linear regression model.","metadata":{}}]}
