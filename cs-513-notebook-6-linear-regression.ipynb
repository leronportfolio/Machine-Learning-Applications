    "\n",
    "Implement `fit`, `_d_cost_function_w` and `_d_cost_function_b`, to represent an appropriate gradient descent algorithm that trains our multiple linear regression model. When complete, you should see the model produce price predictions that begin to approach a \"best fit\" for the simple training data above (note: there are particular reasons why the fit will not be as 'perfect' as our univariate example). Here are some suggestions for completing your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the existing MultipleLinearRegressor class definition above.\n",
    "2. Run your code frequently, using _Run All_ and running the code in the \"Test Run\" code cell above.\n",
    "2. Draw inspiration from the UnivariateLinearRegressor - the structure of gradient descent remains the same, we just need to handle a vector of weights and features.\n",
    "3. Consider replicating the small steps taken in the exploration. Start with `fit`.\n",
    "4. Review the Exploration content and familiarize yourself with the expressions for computing the partial derivatives with respect to `w` and `b` when using a _vector_ of weights and features.\n",
    "5. Implement just _one_ of the partial derivative functions first, and verify that the prediction output has changed.\n",
    "6. For convenience, you can create a new code cell with the class definition, data, instantiation and usage all in one code cell if you wish. But when complete, please be sure that you remove it, and that the MultipleLinearRegressor class definition above is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best tip for thinking about this challenge is to become intimately familiar with the expressions for computing the gradients, or partial derivatives, for w and b. Then, try first working out on paper how your implementation of these computations might work, given the vector of weights and features."

    "## 💡 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I reviewed the existing code for MultipleLinearRegressor and noted that it required the implementation of fit, _d_cost_function_w, and _d_cost_function_b to perform the appropriate gradient descent algorithm to train the multiple linear regression model. I then use similar formatting as the LinearRegressor section and the expressions for computing the partial derivatives win terms of w and b when using a vector of weights and features.I implemented the fit function and computed the delta_w and delta_b for each iteration using the alpha value provided and updated the self.w and self.b values accordingly. I converted the input x_train to a numpy array and computed the mean and standard deviation along the appropriate axis. After that, I then used the features by subtracting the mean and dividng it by the std. I initialized the weight vector as vector of zeros after. Inside the training loop, I made it calculate cost function with respect to the weight vector and bias terms using partial derivatives, and updated them by subtracting respective gradients that is scaled by the learning rate. I tried repeating this process multiple times until it satisfy what I am looking for. In the end, the MultipleLinearRegression can take on many multiple features, and calculate gradients for each of the weight and bias (and update them) in order to help better the relationship between different inputs (multiple) features and target variable.\n",

    "In part 2, I first explored the dataset and understand the rows and columns. After I observed what the dataset contains and have it split into traning and testing sets. I dived into applying preprocessing ways (standardization) using the StandardScaler library and input it into a workflow with Pipeline. I tried different hyperparameter configurations, and focused on the learning rate using SGDRegressor. The results doesn't seem to satisfy what I wanted it to do, hence resulted in poor model performance. It was evaluated using both the training and test sets, which were signifcantly negative and poor model choice. I could try to explore nonlinear models, and incorporate more factors that may alter the accuracy. I could apply methods such as transforming features as well. "
